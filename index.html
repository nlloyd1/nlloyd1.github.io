                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate computer science major from Johnston, Iowa.
                    Before transferring to Iowa State University, I completed the first three semesters of my Bachelor's degree at the University of Iowa, where I held a second major in history.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My primary interests in the computer science field are in the fields of cryptography and cybersecurity. 
                    I hope to gain more academic and professional experience in these fields with the possibility of completing a Master's degree.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am currently employed by iD Tech as a virtual computer science instructor for grade school children.
                    During my time with iD Tech, I have developed a passion for teaching and a desire to share my academic skills and experiences with the next generation of computer science students.
                    Between my academics, employment, and independent learning, I have experience programming in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to my computer science education, I have continuously contributed to the academic and professional history community.
                    My classes and employment in the history field have placed  focus on public digital humanities. 
                    I have used these opportunities to combine my passion for history and education with my skills in computer science to create an engaging digital experience.
